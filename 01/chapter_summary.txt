■ Go is a programming language that is well suited for web programming because it allows web applications that are scalable, modular, maintainable, and highly performant to be written relatively easily. 
■ Web applications are programs that return HTML to the calling client through HTTP, so understanding HTTP well is very important when learning how to write web applications. 
■ HTTP is a simple, stateless, text-based client-server protocol used in exchanging data between a client and a server. ■ HTTP requests and responses are structured with similar formats—they start with a request (or response status) line, followed by one or more headers and an option body. 
■ Every HTTP request has a request line that contains an HTTP method that indicates the action asked of the server, the two most popular being GET and POST. 
■ Every HTTP response has a response status line that tells the calling client the status of the request.
■ There are two major parts of any web application that correspond to requests and responses—handlers and the template engine. 
■ Handlers receive HTTP requests and process them. 
■ The template engine generates HTML that is sent back as part of the HTTP response.
